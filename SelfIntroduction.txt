Good morning!

Hai, my name is Santha Kumar. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to introduce myself.

I am currently staying in Hyderabad but born and brought up in Andhra Pradesh.
I graduated in 2022 with a BSc degree, achieving a commendable 7.6 CGPA, from Sir CR Reddy (A) Degree College.

I love watching movies based on real stories, reading books.

I consider myself a good listener and believe in understanding people before expressing my thoughts.

Being emotional is one of my qualities that both enriches and sometimes bothers me.

In my family, there are four members, including me. My father is a farmer,
 my mother is a proud homemaker, and I have an elder brother who is employed at Skylark Company, working in network marketing.

As for my project, I recently completed a Payroll Management System.
 The project involved developing a comprehensive web application using Spring Boot for the backend and React for the frontend.
 It provided a centralized platform for managing various aspects of the employee lifecycle, 
 from candidate hiring to employee information management. I thoroughly enjoyed being part of the team and
 contributing as a Java Developer to enhance the system's performance and data security.
